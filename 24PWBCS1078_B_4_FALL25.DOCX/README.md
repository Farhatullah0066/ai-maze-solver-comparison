 AI Maze Solver & Pathfinding Comparison A Comparative Study of Informed and Uninformed Search AlgorithmsThis project explores the efficiency of various Artificial Intelligence search strategies—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search—in navigating a 10x10 grid-based maze. The application includes a real-time visualization dashboard built with Streamlit.🌟 Key FeaturesMultiple Search Algorithms: Switch between A*, BFS, and DFS to see how different logics explore the search space.Performance Metrics: Real-time data on Path Length, Nodes Expanded, and Execution Time.Interactive UI: A sidebar-controlled Streamlit app that allows users to start the solver and view results instantly.Visual Analysis: Color-coded grid maps showing the final path, walls, and the starting/ending points.🧠 Algorithmic OverviewAlgorithmTypeStrategyOptimalityA*Informed$f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$Yes (Guaranteed shortest path)BFSUninformedLayer-by-layer expansionYes (Shortest path in unweighted grids)DFSUninformedDeep branch explorationNo (Finds any path, often non-optimal)🛠️ Installation & Setup1. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-maze-solver-comparison.git
cd ai-maze-solver-comparison
2. Install DependenciesBashpip install streamlit matplotlib pandas
3. Generate Data & RunBashpython save_pkl.py
streamlit run app.py
📊 Results and AnalysisThe project demonstrates that A* Search is the most efficient informed strategy, as it uses the Manhattan Distance heuristic to minimize the number of nodes expanded while maintaining path optimality.📂 File Structureapp.py: The main Streamlit application and UI logic.save_pkl.py: Script to initialize and save the maze structure.maze_data.pkl: Serialized maze data used by the solver.maze_solver.ipynb: Original research notebook with raw algorithm tests.requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
